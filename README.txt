This is lab 1 for CMSC 22311.

To run, first run ./suck urls.txt. This will
create a sokal.model file. Then, to spew approximately
n words, run ./spew n from the same directory as the
sokal.model file.

The run directory contains binaries for suck and spew
compiled on OS X, as well as a sokal.model file and the
urls.txt file.
